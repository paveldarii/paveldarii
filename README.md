### How do I deal with tough problem/bugs in Web Development?

First Note: In my opinion, any problem that is subdued to mathematical or physics laws can be resolved.

Second Note: The ideas bellow might not be applicable as mentioned because they are very general; however, they demonstrates my universal strategy and attitude about any problem or bug in programming.

1. I learn the problem carefully until I understand it.

   a. If I don't understand the problem; then, it means that I don't have all tools in my mind to understand it.

   1. I can try to understand the problem by messing with the code. ("Which sometimes is not the best option")
   2. I can learn about the specific Web Technology that is part of the problem from a reliable resource.
   3. If I am lost and there is no value in spending hours on finding the root of the problem; then, I ask for the advise of an expert.("With a well defined question")

   b. If I don't understand the problem; then, I can't move to the next step.

2. After I understand the problem, I plan about what tools do I need to have or to know so I will be ready to resolve it.
3. I implement my ideas.
